## A Longitudinal AI Governance Framework

## Overview

This repository hosts the **public reference white paper** for the  
**Longitudinal Relational Governance Framework™ (LRGF)**.

The paper introduces a governance model for identifying how **risk, harm,
and instability accumulate over time** in AI systems, platforms, and
organizations—beyond what point-in-time audits or compliance checks can detect.

This repository contains the **authoritative public version** of the white paper.
It does **not** disclose proprietary audit tooling, datasets, or internal
implementation methods.

## Abstract

This white paper establishes that:

- Snapshot AI audits fail to capture slow-forming governance risk
- Repeated AI use reshapes judgment, escalation behavior, and accountability
- Behavioral drift and retention normalization can mask harm
- Governance failures often emerge *between* incidents, not at them
- Longitudinal, behavior-based analysis is required for meaningful oversight

## What This Paper Covers

- Why point-in-time AI audits are structurally insufficient  
- How behavioral drift becomes organizational infrastructure  
- The relationship between retention, trust, and hidden harm  
- Escalation decay and override
